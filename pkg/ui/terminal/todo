----------------------

1. Custom Color Scheme
Background Color: Set a dark background color for better readability and to mimic the appearance of traditional terminals.
Text Color: Use a contrasting light text color for visibility against the dark background.
2. Custom Fonts
Use monospaced fonts which are commonly used in coding and terminal environments for their clarity and alignment.
3. Text Highlighting
Error Messages: Use a different color (e.g., red) to highlight error messages.
Success Messages: Use a color like green to denote successful operations or confirmations.
4. Padding and Spacing
Add padding inside the terminal output area to ensure that text does not stick to the borders, making it easier to read.
5. Scrollbar Customization
Customize the scrollbar to match the overall theme of the terminal, possibly making it minimalistic or blending with the background.
6. Text Wrapping
Ensure that the text wrapping is handled gracefully so that long lines are easy to read without disrupting the user interface layout.
7. Interactive Elements
Although the output is read-only, you might add functionality like copying text from the output, searching within the output, or other interactive features.
8. Animation for Updates
Subtly animate new text additions to the output area (e.g., fading in new lines) to make the terminal feel more dynamic.
